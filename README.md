Welcome to my 3D art portfolio! Here, you'll find a collection of my never-seen-before 3D art pieces. My aim is to create a simple, minimal, yet cool website that showcases my work in the best possible way.

## Design Elements
I have taken care to ensure that the design of my website is simple, minimal, and cool, in order to provide the best possible viewing experience for my visitors. Here are the key design elements that you can expect to find on my website:

### * Simple: My website has been designed with simplicity in mind, so that visitors can easily navigate and explore my 3D art pieces.

### * Minimal: I have used a minimal design approach, so that the focus is on my artwork and not on unnecessary design elements.

### * Cool: I want my website to stand out, which is why I have incorporated some cool design elements that will make your visit to my portfolio a memorable one.
